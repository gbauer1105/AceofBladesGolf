# golfps+booking+lesson+handicap
I am attempting to create an all in one mobile application that will encompass booking a tee time, scheduling a lessong with a professional, using GPS during your round of golf and tracking your scores to provide a USGA Handicap.

Far from complete, I have only been able to start with the initial content and build of the GPS functionality
This app will eventually include support for iOS as well.

Please feel free to provide me with any feedback for the development as well as the look and feel of the UI.
